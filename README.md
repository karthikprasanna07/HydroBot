🤖 Aqua Surface Cleaner Bot

An Arduino-powered robotic prototype designed to clean stagnant water surfaces in tanks, ponds, or small lakes. Developed as part of a Hackathon conducted by the ECE Department.

🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Wireless communication modules (WiFi/Xbee)
- Turbidity and Weight Sensors
- DC Gear motors
- Motor Drive
- Li-ion Battery

⚙️ Working Principle
- Water-level sensors detect surface water depth.
- Arduino controls motors based on sensor input.
- The bot moves across the water to clear floating debris using an app controlled manually.

📍 Features
- Low-cost and efficient
- Automatic surface cleaning
- Easy to deploy and operate
